In todayâ€™s Automation Minute, we are going to create a SSH Client in Visual Studio 2017 that uses a GUI to send and receive CLI commands to our Cisco routers and switches.  First, we will create a copy of the Visual Studio TCP Client and GUI we created in video <a href="https://youtu.be/Jft1-d-W7S4">NE# 66</a> so we can reuse the subroutines and GUI code.  Second, we will go over the code changes made for using the SSH.Net library vs the TCPClient Library.  Then, we will do a quick demo of our new Cisco CLI GUI to see how good it works
